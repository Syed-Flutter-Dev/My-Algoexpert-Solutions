# Problem Statement:

Write a function that takes in three strings and returns a boolean representing whether the third string can be formed by interweaving the first two strings.
To interweave strings means to merge them by alternating their letters without any specific pattem. For instance. the strings "abc" and "123" can be interwovenas "alb2c3" . as "abc123" , and as "ablc23" (this list is nonexhaustive).
Letters within a string must maintain their relative ordering in the interwoven string.

## Sample Input

```cpp
one =  "algoexpert"
two = "your-dream-job"
three = "your-algodream-expertjob"
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
true
```

# *Solution 1 :*

- [x]  Done on my own with small hint

## Explanation :

Since letters have to be taken "IN ORDER" we can employ this recursion method.

RECURSION

## Code :

```cpp
def interweavingStrings(one, two, three):
	
	if len(one) + len(two) != len(three):
		return False
	
	m = len(one) + 1
	n = len(two) + 1

	def another(s1,s2,s3,m,n,p,s):

		if len(s) == len(s3):
			return s == s3

		firstResult = False
		secondResult = False

		if m < len(s1) and s1[m] == s3[p]:
			firstResult = another(s1,s2,s3,m+1,n,p+1,s + s1[m])

		if n < len(s2) and s2[n] == s3[p]:
			secondResult = another(s1,s2,s3,m,n+1,p+1,s + s2[n])

		return firstResult or secondResult

	return another(one,two,three,0,0,0,"")
```

## Time Space Complexity :

Watch the algoexpert video not sure about this

MEMOIZATION

```python
def interweavingStrings(one, two, three):
	
	if len(one) + len(two) != len(three):
		return False
	
	m = len(one) + 1
	n = len(two) + 1

	t = [[-1]*n for _ in range(m+1)]
	
	def another(s1,s2,s3,m,n,p,s):
		
		if t[m][n] != -1:
			return t[m][n]

		if len(s) == len(s3):
			return s == s3

		firstResult = False
		secondResult = False

		if m < len(s1) and s1[m] == s3[p]:
			firstResult = another(s1,s2,s3,m+1,n,p+1,s + s1[m])

		if n < len(s2) and s2[n] == s3[p]:
			secondResult = another(s1,s2,s3,m,n+1,p+1,s + s2[n])

		t[m][n] = firstResult or secondResult
		
		return t[m][n]

	return another(one,two,three,0,0,0,"")
```

TABULAR METHOD [ BOTTOM UP DP ]

```python
def interweavingStrings(one, two, three):
	
    if len(one) + len(two) != len(three):
		return False
	
	# if any letter from both words is not present in either of the words
	# return False as interleaving not possible
	for i in range(max(len(one),len(two))):
		if i < len(one) and one[i] not in three:
			return False
		if i < len(two) and two[i] not in three:
			return False
	
	m = len(one) + 1
	n = len(two) + 1
	dp = [[1 if (i==0 and j==0) else 0 for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
	
	# initialize base cases in matrix
	i=0
	for j in range(1,m):
		if one[j-1] == three[j-1]: 
			dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
			
	j=0
	for i in range(1,n):
		if two[i-1] == three[i-1]: 
			dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
	
	# start the loop
	for r in range(1,n):
		for c in range(1,m):
			
			if two[r-1] == three[r+c-1] and one[c-1] != three[r+c-1]:
				dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c]
			elif one[c-1] == three[r+c-1] and two[r-1] != three[r+c-1]:
				dp[r][c] = dp[r][c-1]
			elif one[c-1] != three[r+c-1] and two[r-1] != three[r+c-1]:
				dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c-1]
			else:
				dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] or dp[r][c-1]
				
				
				
	return dp[-1][-1]
