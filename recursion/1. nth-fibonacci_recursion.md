# *Problem Statement :*

Nth Fibonacci The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is e , the second number is I , and the nth number is the sum of the (n - l)th and (n - 2)th numbers. 

Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number. lmFX)rtant note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as FO = e and .

 For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is Fe ; therefore, getNthFib(1) 1 is equal to FO , getNthFib(2) is equal to FI , etc..

fib ( 1 ) —> 0 [ 1rst element ]

fib ( 2 ) —> 1 [ 2nd element ]

## Sample Input

```cpp
n = 6
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
5
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

Recursive

## Code :

```cpp
def getNthFib(n):
	
	if n==1:
		return 0
	if n==2:
		return 1
	
	return getNthFib(n-1) + getNthFib(n-2)
```

Dynamic Programming

```python
def getNthFib(n):
    
	dp = [1 if i==2 else 0 for i in range(n+1)]
	
	for i in range(3,n+1):
		dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
		
	return dp[-1]
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

Recursion → O ( 2 ^ N ) Time

DP → O ( N ) Time and O ( N ) Space
