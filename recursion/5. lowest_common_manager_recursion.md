# Problem Statement:

You're given three inputs. all of which are instances of an orgchart class that have a directReports property pointing to their direct reports. The first input is the top manager in an organizational chart (i.e.. the only instance that isn't anymdy else's direct report), and the other two inputs are reports in the organizational chart. The two reports are guaranteed to be distinct.
Write a function that retums the lowest common manager to the two reports.

## Sample Input

```cpp
// From the organizational chart below.
topManager = Node A
reportOne = Node E
reportTwo = Node I
          A
       /     \
      B       C
    /   \   /   \
   D     E F     G
 /   \
H     I
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
Node B
```

# *Solution 1 :*

- [x]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

Leverage the power of Recursion and return 1 when either **report node** is hit, and return the "sum" variable at every instance. [ 0 is automatically returned if nothing is returned so summing seems a good trick ]

Dont forget to add the sum of all child nodes,

That way, at some node X , the sum will be 2 ........ [ meaning two nodes are hit ]. Theres your manager.

## Code :

```cpp
def getLowestCommonManager(topManager, reportOne, reportTwo):
    nodes = []
	
	if topManager == reportOne or topManager==reportTwo :
		return topManager
	
	def lcm(node,reportOne,reportTwo,nodes):
	
		sum = 0
		
		for child in node.directReports:
			sum += lcm(child,reportOne,reportTwo,nodes)
			
		if node == reportOne or node == reportTwo:
			sum+=1
		
		if sum >= 2:
			nodes.append(node)
			
		return sum
	
	lcm(topManager,reportOne,reportTwo,nodes)
	
	return nodes[0]

# This is an input class. Do not edit.
class OrgChart:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.directReports = []
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N ) Time | O ( D ) Space

Where N is the number of nodes in the tree and D is the depth of the organisational tree.

# *Solution 2 :*

- [ ]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

EXACTLY same as above but a bit cleaner approach with less space. ( In previous approach all nodes were being stored but here only the lowest common manager will be stored )

## Code :

```cpp
def getLowestCommonManager(topManager, reportOne, reportTwo):
    lowestCommonManager = None
	
	if topManager == reportOne or topManager==reportTwo :
		return topManager
	
	def lcm(node,reportOne,reportTwo,lowestCommonManager):
		
		# once the manager is found, terminate all other calls and return the manager
		if lowestCommonManager is not None:
			return [0,lowestCommonManager]
		
		sum = 0
		
		for child in node.directReports:
			sumreturned,lowestCommonManager = lcm(child,reportOne,reportTwo,lowestCommonManager)
			sum += sumreturned
			
		if node == reportOne or node == reportTwo:
			sum+=1
		
		if sum >= 2 and lowestCommonManager == None:
			lowestCommonManager = node
			
		return [sum,lowestCommonManager]
	
	sum,lowestCommonManager = lcm(topManager,reportOne,reportTwo,lowestCommonManager)
	
	return lowestCommonManager

# This is an input class. Do not edit.
class OrgChart:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.directReports = []
```
