# Problem Statement:

Given *n* non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

# *Solution 1 :*

- [x]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

I remembered the [ left to right | right to left ] pattern from the [Min Rewards [ local min/max ]](https://www.notion.so/Min-Rewards-local-min-max-c238499f8eb64797b856ccc22ed1ca66) problem and attempted to solve it, since it looked a bit similar. Closely observing we can find that we need the min of the left and right Maximum Pillar, which is why i tried this. However it was not very obvious, just an intuition.

## Code :

```cpp
def waterArea(heights):
	
	waterFromLeft = [0 for _ in range(len(heights))]
	waterFromRight = [0 for _ in range(len(heights))]
	
	maxPillar = 0
	
	# first traversal left to right
	for i in range(len(heights)):
		
		if heights[i] >= maxPillar:
			maxPillar = heights[i]
			waterFromLeft[i] = 0
			
		elif heights[i] < maxPillar:
			waterFromLeft[i] = maxPillar - heights[i]
	
	maxPillar = 0
	# second traversal right to left
	for i in range(len(heights)-1,-1,-1):
		
		if heights[i] >= maxPillar:
			waterFromRight[i] = 0
			maxPillar = heights[i]
			
		elif heights[i] < maxPillar:
			waterFromRight[i] = maxPillar - heights[i]
			
	water = [ min(waterFromLeft[i],waterFromRight[i]) for i in range(len(heights)) ]
	
	return sum(water)
```

The solution has 3 arrays above, we can reduce it to one array

```python
def waterArea(heights):
	
	water = [ 0 for _ in range(len(heights))]
	maxPillar = 0
	
	# first traversal left to right
	for i in range(len(heights)):
		
		if heights[i] >= maxPillar:
			maxPillar = heights[i]
			water[i] = 0
			
		elif heights[i] < maxPillar:
			water[i] = maxPillar - heights[i]
	
	maxPillar = 0
	# second traversal right to left
	for i in range(len(heights)-1,-1,-1):
		
		if heights[i] >= maxPillar:
			water[i] = 0
			maxPillar = heights[i]
			
		elif heights[i] < maxPillar:
			water[i] = min(water[i],maxPillar - heights[i])
	
	return sum(water)
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N ) Time | O ( N ) Space

# *Solution 2 :*

- [ ]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

A solution with O ( 1 ) Space.

plant two pointers, one at end and one at start

- Measure Both heights
    - Increment pointer with lower height
    - determine if that is the leftmax or not
    - add surface area of leftmax - currHeight

acc to me, idea is that.. the minimum of both is the amount of water that will be stored in any case

Run a few testcases on this code before going ahead

## Code :

```cpp
def waterArea(heights):
	
	if len(heights) == 0:
		return 0
    
	leftIdx = 0
	leftMax = heights[leftIdx]
	rightIdx = len(heights)-1
	rightMax = heights[rightIdx]
	surfaceArea = 0
	
	while leftIdx < rightIdx:
		
		if heights[leftIdx] < heights[rightIdx]:
			
			leftIdx+=1
			leftMax = max(leftMax , heights[leftIdx])
			surfaceArea += leftMax - heights[leftIdx]
			
		else:
			
			rightIdx-=1
			rightMax = max(rightMax , heights[rightIdx])
			surfaceArea += rightMax - heights[rightIdx]
			
	return surfaceArea
```
