# *Problem Statement :*

You're given an array of arrays where each subarray holds two integer values and represents an item; the first integer is the item's value, and the second integer is the item's weight. 

You're also given an integer representing the maximum capacity of a knapsack that you have. 

Your goal is to fit items in your knapsack without having the sum of their weights exceed the knapsack's capacity, all the while maximizing their combined value. 

Note that you only have one of each item at your disposal. 

Write a function that returns the maximized combined value of the items that you should pick as well as an array of the indices of each item picked. 

If there are multiple combinations of items that maximize the total value in the knapsack, your function can return any of them.

## Sample Input

```cpp
items = [[1, 2], [4, 3], [5, 6], [6, 7]]
capacity = 10
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
[10, [1, 3]]
// items [4, 3] and [6, 7]
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

## Code :

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int knapsack(vector<int> w, vector<int> v,int W ,int n , vector<int> &result, vector<vector<int>> &matrix)
{
	//base case taken care of since already initialized to 0
	for(int i=1 ; i < w.size() + 1 ; i++)
	{
		for(int j=1 ; j < W + 1 ; j++)
		{
			if(w[i-1] <= j)
			{
				
				matrix[i][j] = max(v[i-1] + matrix[i-1][j - w[i-1]] , matrix[i-1][j]); 
				
			}else{
				
				matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j];
				
			}
		}
	}
	
	int capacity = W;
	int items = n;
	
	//Backtracking and firguring out which items were chosen from the matrix
	//Every box of the matrix represents a small case, whether the item was chosen or not;
	//I felt it was like OR, where we had tradeoffs, whether take the object or not, weigh the value.
	while(capacity > 0 && items > 0)
	{
		if(matrix[items][capacity] == matrix[items-1][capacity])
		{
			
			items--;
			
		}else{
			//WHY ITEMS-1 ??  well because technically you are chosing the 2nd item lets say, but unfortunately array indices dont work that way
			//so you minus one number so the you get the INDEX of the item.
			result.push_back(items-1);
			items--;
			capacity = capacity - w[items];
			
		}
	}
	
	return matrix[n][W];
	
}

vector<vector<int>> knapsackProblem(vector<vector<int>> items, int capacity) {
  vector<int> values;
	vector<int> weights;
	vector<int> result;
	
	for(vector<int> row : items){values.push_back(row[0]);}
	for(vector<int> row : items){weights.push_back(row[1]);}
	
	//initalize the matrix
	vector<vector<int>> matrix(weights.size()+1,vector<int>(capacity+1,0));
	
	int totalValue = knapsack(weights,values,capacity,weights.size(),result,matrix);
	
  return {
      {totalValue},   // total value
      result, // item indices
  };
}
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

O(nc) time | O(nc) space - where n is the number of items and c is the capacity
