Also included in the Dynamic Programming Notebook with more clear explanations

# Problem Statement:

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for  is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.

## Sample Input

```cpp
{ 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 }
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
 6   // { 10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80 }
```

## Explanation :

Tabular Method

## Code :

```cpp
import sys
def longestIncreasingSubsequence(array):
    
	sequence = [None for _ in range(len(array))]
	dp = [0 for i in range(len(array))]
	
	for i in range(1,len(array)):
		currentElement = array[i]
		
		for j in range(i):
			otherElement = array[j]
			
			if otherElement < currentElement and dp[j]+1 > dp[i]:
				dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
				sequence[i] = j
	print(dp)	
	return buildsequence(sequence,dp.index(max(dp)),array)

def buildsequence(sequence,maxIndex,array):
	lis = []
	while maxIndex is not None:
		
		lis.append(array[maxIndex])
		maxIndex = sequence[maxIndex]
	return list(reversed(lis))
```
