# Problem Statement:

Write a function that takes in a square-shaped n x n two-dimensional array of only 1s and Os and returns a boolean representing whether the input matrix contains a square whose borders are made up of only 0s.

Note : 1x1 element is not counted as a square.

## Sample Input

```cpp
matrix = = [
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
]
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
True
/*
[
	[ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ],
	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  ],
	[0,  ,  ,  , 0,  ],
	[0,  ,  ,  , 0,  ],
	[0,  ,  ,  , 0,  ],
	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  ],
]
*/
```

# *Solution 1 :*

- [ ]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

**PART 1 :** 

Treat each cell of the matrix as the top-left corner of a square and expand to every square size starting from 2 to as big as possible staying in matrix limits. For every square call a findsquare(r1,c1,r2,c2) function

PART 2 :

In the findsquare function check if all the borders are made up of zeroes

## Code :

```cpp
def squareOfZeroes(matrix):
	
	# Number of rows
	rows = len(matrix)
	
	# Number of columns
	cols = len(matrix[0])
	
	# last row and column skipped to avoid runtime error
	for r in range(rows-1):
		for c in range(cols-1):
			# optimize algorithm to start only from a corner whose value is zero
			if matrix[r][c]==0:
				
				# initialize corners of square
				i=r+1
				j=c+1
				
				while i < rows and j < cols:
					
					if findsquare(r,c,i,j,matrix,rows,cols):
						# return true if square found
						return True
					
					# Increment square size
					i+=1
					j+=1
					
	# return false if no square found
	return False
	
def findsquare(r1,c1,r2,c2,matrix,rows,cols):
	
	# rows fixed, going horizontal -->
	for c in range(c1,c2+1):
		# return false if even one non-zero value found
		if matrix[r1][c] != 0 or matrix[r2][c] != 0:
			return False
	
	# cols fixed, going vertical /|\ 
	for r in range(r1,r2+1):
		# return false if even one non-zero value found
		if matrix[r][c1] != 0 or matrix[r][c2] != 0:
			return False
	
	# if all values are zero return True
	return True
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N^3 ) TIME | O ( 1 ) SPACE

Finding all squares takes â€”> N^3, how ? maybe a maths proof

## Explanation :

TO:DO --> There are 2 more solutions, a recursive one with cache, and another with an optimization.

Watch the algoexpert video on this topic and write both of them here
