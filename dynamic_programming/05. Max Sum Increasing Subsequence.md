# Problem Statement:

Given an array of n positive integers. Write a program to find the sum of maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. 

## Sample Input

```cpp
array = [ 10 , 70 , 20 , 30 , 50 , 11 , 30 ]
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
[110, [10, 20, 30, 50]] // The subsequence [10, 20, 30, 50] is strictly increasing and yields the greatest sum: 110.
```

## Explanation :

Coded this on my own, doesn't feel like the most optimized solution, so check other one ( imposter syndrome ? ).

Problem was very similar to Longest Increasing Subsequence but here the **INCENTIVE** was 

not for the maximum length, but the maximum SUM. So i tweaked the problem seeing the 

previous one, and therefore we can say that understanding a problem can lead to solving many types of problems, so definitely understand all of them, DO NOT RUSH.

## Code :

```cpp
def maxSumIncreasingSubsequence(array):
	
	# initialize result list to store sums for individual elements
	result = [0 for _ in range(len(array))]
	
	# initialize dictionary to store list of sequence associated with every element
	chosen = {}
	for i in array:
		chosen.setdefault(i,[i])
		
	# initialization + base cases covered, now initiate logic	
	for i in range(0,len(array)):
		result[i] = array[i]
		maxNum = 0
		
		for j in range(i):
	
			if array[j] < array[i]:
			
				if array[i] + result[j] > maxNum:
					
					maxNum = array[i] + result[j]
					chosen.update({ array[i] : [array[i]] + chosen[array[j]] })
					
		# condition to ensure minimum is always element itself		
		result[i] = maxNum if maxNum!=0 else array[i]		
		
	# find index of max in result array and then sequence associated with it from array[i]
	associatedSequence = sorted(chosen[array[result.index(max(result))]])
	
	return [max(result), associatedSequence ]
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N ^ 2 ) Time and O ( N ) Space

# *Solution 1 :*

- [ ]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

Solution from algoexpert, a bit more modular and clean. REBUILDING SEQUENCE IN DP is important and something that often comes in problems so master this approach, using a dictionary seems space heavy

## Code :

```cpp
def maxSumIncreasingSubsequence(array):
    
	sequences = [None for x in range(len(array))]
	sums = array[:]
	maxSumIdx = 0
	
	for i in range(len(array)):
		
		currentNum = array[i]
		for j in range(i):
			
			otherNum = array[j]
			
			if otherNum < currentNum and sums[j] + currentNum > sums[i]:
				
				sums[i] = sums[j] + currentNum
				sequences[i] = j
		
		if sums[i] >= sums[maxSumIdx]:
			maxSumIdx = i
	
	return [sums[maxSumIdx] , buildSequence(array,sequences,maxSumIdx)]

def buildSequence(array,sequences,currentIdx):
	sequence = []
	
	while currentIdx is not None:
		
		sequence.append(array[currentIdx])
		currentIdx = sequences[currentIdx]
	
	return list(reversed(sequence))
```
