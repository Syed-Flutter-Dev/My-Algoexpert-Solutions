# Problem Statement:

You're given a non-empty array of arrays where each subarray holds three integers an
These integers denote each disk's [ width, depth, and height ], respectively. Your goal is to stack up the disks and to maximize the total height of the stack. A disk must have a strictly smaller width, depth and height than any other disk below it.

Write a function that returns an array of the disks in the final stack, starting with the top disk and ending with the bottom disk. Note that you can't rotate disks, in other words, the integers in each sub-array must represent [ width , height , depth ] at all times.

You may assume there will be only one stack with max height.

## Sample Input

```cpp
disks = [[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [2, 2, 8], [2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 1], [4, 4, 5]]
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
[[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [4, 4, 5]]
// 10 (2 + 3 + 5) is the tallest height we can get by
// stacking disks following the rules laid out above.
```

## Explanation :

Code well commented, seems self-explanatory.

## Code :

```cpp
def diskStacking(disks):
    
	# sort disks according to their heights
	disks.sort(key=lambda m:m[2])
	
	# keep track of the last element with max height when added
	sequence = [None for _ in range(len(disks))]
	
	# next best height possible stored for every element
	heightValues = [m[2] for m in disks]
	
	# traverse all disks
	for i in range(len(disks)):
		
		currentDisk = disks[i]
		height = heightValues[i]
		maxHeightThusFar = height
		
		for j in range(i,len(disks)):
			otherDisk = disks[j]
			
			# Check if the other disk obeys all conditions to be stacked below
			if currentDisk[0] < otherDisk[0] and currentDisk[1] < otherDisk[1] and currentDisk[2] < otherDisk[2]:
				
				# maxHeightThusFar only calculates maxheight possible for the currentDisk,
				# but for the other disk, a greater height might be possible with another disk
				# so an extra check below this one is needed
				if maxHeightThusFar < height + otherDisk[2]:
					maxHeightThusFar = height + otherDisk[2]
					
					# if the max height thus far, is greater than what the otherDisk already has,
					# Then replace our "maxHeightThusFar" since we want max height, otherwise ignore
					# record sequence to return in case this is the max sequence 
					if heightValues[j] < maxHeightThusFar:
						sequence[j] = i
						heightValues[j] = maxHeightThusFar
			
	# get the index of the disk with max height and build sequence from there
	index = heightValues.index(max(heightValues))
	return buildSequence(index,sequence,disks)

def buildSequence(index,sequence,disks):
	result = []
	while index is not None:
		result.append(disks[index])
		index = sequence[index]
		
	return list(reversed(result))
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N ^ 2 ) TIME | O ( N ) SPACE

Where N is number of disks
