# *Problem Statement :*

Writea function that takes inastring made up of brackets ( ( , [ , { , ) , ] , and } ) and other optional characters. 

The function should return a boolean representing whether the string is balanced regards to brackets. 

A string is said to balanced if it has as many brackets of a certain as it has closing br√¶kec of that and if no bracket is unmatched. 

Note that an opening bracket can't match a corresponding closing bracket that comes it. and similarly, a closing bracket can't match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it.

Also, brackets can't overlap each other as in **( [ ) ]**

## Sample Input

```cpp
string = "([])(){}(())()()"
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
true
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

## Code :

Python

```python
def balancedBrackets(string):
    
	left = []
	
	for i in string:
		
		if i == "(" or i == "[" or i == "{":
			left.append(i)
		
		# if no opening brackets left to match
		# it certainly is unbalanced
		elif len(left) == 0:
			return False
		
		elif i == ")":
			if left[-1] == "(":
				left.pop()
			else:
				return False
		
		elif i == "]":
			if left[-1] == "[":
				left.pop()
			else:
				return False
		
		elif i == "}":
			if left[-1] == "{":
				left.pop()
			else:
				return False
			
		# for any other optional characters	
		else:
			pass
			
	return len(left) == 0
```

C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool balancedBrackets(string str) {
  // Write your code here.
	stack<char> s;
	
	for(int i=0 ; i<str.length() ; i++)
	{
		if(str[i] == '(' || str[i] == '[' || str[i] == '{' )
		{
			s.push(str[i]);
			
		}else if( str[i] == ')' || str[i] == ']' || str[i] == '}' )
		{
			if(!s.empty())
			{
				// abs(str[i] - s.top()) is an ascii value trick
				bool iscorrect = abs(str[i] - s.top()) < 5;
				s.pop();
				if(!iscorrect){return false;}
				
			}
			else
			{
				
				return false;
			}
		}
	}
  return s.empty();
}
```
