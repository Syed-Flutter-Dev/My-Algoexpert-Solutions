# *Problem Statement :*

Write three functions that take in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an empty array, traverse the BST, add its nodes' values to the input array, and return that array. 

The three functions should traverse the BST using the in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree-traversal techniques, respectively. 

If you're unfamiliar with tree-traversal techniques, we recommend watching the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting to code. 

Each BST node has an integer value , a left child node, anda right child node. 

A node is said to valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property:

- its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left;
- its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right;
- and its children nodes are either valid BST ncxies themselves or None / null

## Sample Input

```cpp
tree =   10
       /     \
      5      15
    /   \       \
   2     5       22
 /
1
array = []
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
inOrderTraverse : [1, 2, 5, 5, 10, 15, 22]
preOrderTraverse : [10, 5, 2, 1, 5, 15, 22]
postOrderTraverse : [1, 2, 5, 5, 22, 15, 10]
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

## Code :

```cpp
def inOrderTraverse(tree, array):
	if tree is None:
		return None
	
    inOrderTraverse(tree.left, array)
	array.append(tree.value)
	inOrderTraverse(tree.right, array)
	
	return array

def preOrderTraverse(tree, array):
    if tree is None:
		return None
	
	array.append(tree.value)
    preOrderTraverse(tree.left, array)
	preOrderTraverse(tree.right, array)
	
	return array

def postOrderTraverse(tree, array):
    if tree is None:
		return None
	
    postOrderTraverse(tree.left, array)
	postOrderTraverse(tree.right, array)
	array.append(tree.value)
	
	return array
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

All three methods: O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST
