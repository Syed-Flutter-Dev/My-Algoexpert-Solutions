# *Problem Statement :*

Write a BST class for a Binary Search Tree. 

The class should support: 

- Inserting values with the insert method.
- Removing values with the remove method ( this method should only remove the first instance of a given value. )
- Searching for values with the contains method.
- Note that you can't remove values from a single-node tree.

In other words, calling the remove method on a single-node tree should simply not do anything.

Each BST node has an integer value , a left child node, anda right child node. 

A node is saidto valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BSTproperty:

its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; 

its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; 

its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

## Code :

```python
# Search Function
def search(root,key):
     
    # Base Cases: root is null or key is present at root
    if root is None or root.val == key:
        return root
 
    # Key is greater than root's key
    if root.val < key:
        return search(root.right,key)
   
    # Key is smaller than root's key
    return search(root.left,key)

# Insert Function
def insert(root,key): 
    if root is None: 
        return Node(key) 
    else:
        if root.val == key:
            return root
        elif root.val < key: 
            root.right = insert(root.right, key) 
        else:
            root.left = insert(root.left, key)
    return root
 
# Delete Function [ slightly tricky , swap with inorder successor]
def deleteNode(root, key): 
  
    # Base Case 
    if root is None: 
        return root  
  
    # If the key to be deleted is smaller than the root's 
    # key then it lies in  left subtree 
    if key < root.key: 
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key) 
  
    # If the kye to be delete is greater than the root's key 
    # then it lies in right subtree 
    elif(key > root.key): 
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key) 
  
    # If key is same as root's key, then this is the node 
    # to be deleted 
    else: 
          
        # Node with only one child or no child 
        if root.left is None : 
            temp = root.right  
            root = None 
            return temp  
              
        elif root.right is None : 
            temp = root.left  
            root = None
            return temp 
  
        # Node with two children: Get the inorder successor 
        # (smallest in the right subtree) 
        temp = minValueNode(root.right) 
  
        # Copy the inorder successor's content to this node 
        root.key = temp.key 
  
        # Delete the inorder successor 
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right , temp.key) 
  
  
    return root

# Delete Function Utitliy Method
def minValueNode(node): 
    current = node 
  
    # loop down to find the leftmost leaf 
    while(current.left is not None): 
        current = current.left  
  
    return current
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

Average (all 3 methods): O(log(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST
Worst (all 3 methods): O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST
