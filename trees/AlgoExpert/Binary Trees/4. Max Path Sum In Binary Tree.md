# Problem Statement:

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and retums its max path sum. 

A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree where no node is connected to more than two other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path. 

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value , a left child node , and a right child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None null .

## Sample Input

```cpp
tree = 1
    /     \
   2       3
 /   \   /   \
4     5 6     7
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
18 // 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 7
```

## Code :

```cpp
def maxPathSum(node):
    
	def pathSum(node):
		if node==None:
			return (0,0)
		if node.left == None and node.right == None:
			return (node.value,node.value)

		V = node.value
		LSB , LS = pathSum(node.left)
		RSB , RS = pathSum(node.right)
		MB = max(LSB,RSB)

		MSB = max(MB + V , V)
		MST = max(MSB , LSB + RSB + V)
		RMPS = max(LS,RS,MST)

		return (MSB,RMPS)
	
	a,b = pathSum(node)
	return max(a,b) if max(a,b)!=0 else -1
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O(n) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree
