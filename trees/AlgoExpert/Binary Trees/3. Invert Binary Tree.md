# *Problem Statement :*

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. 

In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node. 

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value , a left child node, and a right child node. 

Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselvesor None / null

## Sample Input

```cpp
tree =    1
       /     \
      2       3
    /   \   /   \
   4     5 6     7
 /   \
8     9
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
			 1
    /     \
   3       2
 /   \   /   \
7     6 5     4
            /   \
           9     8
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

## Code :

```cpp
def invertBinaryTree(tree):
	
	# base case
	if tree is None :
		return tree

	# recurse till base case reached
	invertBinaryTree(tree.left)
	invertBinaryTree(tree.right)

	# swap subtree nodes
	tree.left , tree.right = tree.right , tree.left

	# return swaped node
	return tree
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

O(n) time | O(d) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree and d is the depth (height) of the Binary Tree
