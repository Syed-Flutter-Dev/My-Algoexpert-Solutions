# *Problem Statement :*

The distance a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's is called the depth. 

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths. 

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value , a left child ncxie, anda right child node. 

Children Nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null

## Sample Input

```cpp
tree  =    1
	       /     \
	      2       3
	    /   \   /   \
	   4     5 6     7
	 /   \
	8     9
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
16
// The depth of the node with value 2 is 1.
// The depth of the node with value 3 is 1.
// The depth of the node with value 4 is 2.
// The depth of the node with value 5 is 2.
// Summing all of these depths yields 16.
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

## Code :

```python
def nodeDepths(root):
    
	def depth(node,level):
		if node is None:
			return 0
		
		rightSum = depth(node.right,level + 1)
		leftSum = depth(node.left,level + 1)
		
		return rightSum + leftSum + level
	
	return depth(root,0)

# This is the class of the input binary tree.
class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

Average case: when the tree is balanced
O(n) time | O(h) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree and h is the height of the Binary Tree
