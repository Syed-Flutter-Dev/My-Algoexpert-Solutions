# Problem Statement:

The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth. Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of all of its subtrees' nodes' depths. Each BinaryTree node has an integer value , a left child node, anda right child node. Child nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null .

## Sample Input

```cpp
tree =    1
       /     \
      2       3
    /   \   /   \
   4     5 6     7
 /   \
8     9
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
26
// The sum of the root tree's node depths is 16.
// The sum of the tree rooted at 2's node depths is 6.
// The sum of the tree rooted at 3's node depths is 2.
// The sum of the tree rooted at 4's node depths is 2.
// Summing all of these sums yields 26.
```

## Explanation :

simple logic, recursively check for every nodes height while traversing recursively

similar to [Node Depths](https://www.notion.so/Node-Depths-1f192f91a49640ffa5140018a51d90c6) but we are doing the same thing for EVERY node

## Code :

```python
def allKindsOfNodeDepths(root):
	
	# function to find Depth Sum of a Node
    def depth(node,level):
		if node is None:
			return 0
		
		rightSum = depth(node.right,level + 1)
		leftSum = depth(node.left,level + 1)
		
		return rightSum + leftSum + level
	
	# while traversing, find depth sum of EVERY node and add it up
	def traverse(node,depth,sumOfDepth):
		if node is None:
			return 0
		
		leftSum = traverse(node.left,depth,sumOfDepth)
		rightSum = traverse(node.right,depth,sumOfDepth)

		return leftSum + rightSum + depth(node,0)
	
	# return the sum
	
	return traverse(root,depth,0)
```

## Time Space Complexity :

Average case: when the tree is balanced
O(n) time | O(h) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree and h is the height of the Binary Tree
