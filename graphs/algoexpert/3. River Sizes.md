# Problem Statement:

You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0 s and 1 s. 

Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a river. 

A river consists of any number of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determine its size. 

Note that a river can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped for example. 

Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix. The sizes don't need to in any particular order.

## Sample Input

```cpp
matrix = = [
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
]
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
[ 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 5 ]
```

# *Solution 1 :*

- [x]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

Code with comments explained below.

basically bfs from every "1" node,

- For every neighbouring node with value "1"
    - increment it to 2 instead of putting in global visited array, howevery local visited array is needed
    - increment count

## Code :

```cpp
from collections import deque
def riverSizes(matrix):
    
	# river sizes
	riverSizes = []
	
	# Number of rows
	rows = len(matrix)
	
	# Number of cols
	cols = len(matrix[0])
	
	# perform bfs
	def bfs(i,j,matrix,rows,cols):
		
		visited = set()
		directions = ((1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1))
		queue = deque([(i,j)])
		
		def traverse(i,j):
			count = 0
			
			while queue:
				i,j = queue.popleft()
				
				if (i,j) not in visited:
					visited.add((i,j))
					count += 1
					
					for a,b in directions:
						nexti= i + a
						nextj = j + b

						if 0 <= nexti < rows and 0 <= nextj < cols and matrix[nexti][nextj]==1:
							
							queue.append((nexti,nextj))
							# instead of maintaining a universal visited array, 
							# change the cell value itself, so it wont be 1 anymore
							matrix[nexti][nextj] += 1
							
			return count
				
		return traverse(i,j)
				
	
	for r in range(rows):
		for c in range(cols):
			
			# start dfs if and only if the element is 1
			if matrix[r][c] == 1:
				result = bfs(r,c,matrix,rows,cols)
				riverSizes.append(result)
				
	return riverSizes
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( I ) TIME | O ( I ) SPACE

where I is the number of i's in the matrix
