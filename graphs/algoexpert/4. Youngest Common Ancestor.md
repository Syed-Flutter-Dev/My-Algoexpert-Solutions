# Problem Statement:

You're given three inputs. all of which are instances of an AncestralTree class that have an ancestor their youngest ancestor. The first input is the top ancestor in an ancestral tree (i.e.. the only instance that has no ancestorâ€”its ancestor property points to None / null and the other two inputs are descendants in the ancestral tree. Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two descendants. Note that a descendant is considered its own ancestor. So in the simple ancestral tree below. The youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is node A

## Sample Input

```cpp
topAncestor = node A
descendentTwo = node E
descendentTwo = node I
          A
       /     \
      B       C
    /   \   /   \
   D     E F     G
 /   \
H     I
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
node B
```

## Explanation :

duhh

## Code :

```cpp
# This is an input class. Do not edit.
class AncestralTree:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.ancestor = None

def getYoungestCommonAncestor(topAncestor, descendantOne, descendantTwo):
    
	done = []
	dtwo = []
	
	while descendantOne is not None:
		done.append(descendantOne)
		descendantOne = descendantOne.ancestor
	while descendantTwo is not None:
		dtwo.append(descendantTwo)
		descendantTwo = descendantTwo.ancestor
		
	for i in range(len(done)):
		
		for j in range(len(dtwo)):
			
			if done[i] == dtwo[j]:
				return done[i]
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( M * N ) Time | O ( N ) Space

where M is the depth of descenedent one and N is the depth of the descendent two

# *Solution 2 :*

- [ ]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

Approach is to calculate the 1rst descendents depth and 2nd descenedents depth.

Deeper depth - higher depth = Difference between both nodes

now take the deeper depth node from its place UP by this DIFFERENCE

This will ensure both are on the same level,

move both UP until they are equal

## Code :

```cpp

```

## Time Space Complexity :

O(d) time | O(1) space - where d is the depth (height) of the ancestral tree
