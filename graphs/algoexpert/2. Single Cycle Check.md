# Problem Statement:

You're given an array of integers where each integer represents a jump of its value in the array. 

For instance, the integer 2 represents a jump of two indices forward in the array; the integer -3 represents a jump of three indices backward in the array. 

If a jump spills past the array's bounds, it wraps overto the other side. For instance, a jump of -1 at index e brings us to the last index in the array. 

Similarly, ajumpof 1 at the last index in the array brings us to index o Write a function that returns a representing whether the jumps in the array form a single cycle. 

A single cycle occurs if, starting at any index in the array and following the jumps, every element in the array is visited exactly once before landing back on the starting index.

## Sample Input

```cpp
array = [2, 3, 1, -4, -4, 2]
```

## Sample Output

```python
True
```

## Explanation :

Dfs from every node while recording how many times every node was visited in the array, and checking if the root node was visited two times since we want the cycle to end on the root node

## Code :

```cpp
def hasSingleCycle(array):
	
	def dfs(i,array):
		
		visited = [0 for _ in range(len(array))]
		n = len(array)
		
		def traverse(i,array):
		
			if i > 0:
				i = i % n
			else:
				i = (n + i) % n
				
			visited[i] += 1
			if visited[i] == 1:
				return 1 + traverse(i + array[i],array)
			return 0
		
		return [traverse(i,array),visited]
	
	
	# dfs from every node
	for i in range(len(array)):
		result,visited = dfs(i,array) 
		print(visited)
		if result == len(array) and visited[i] > 1:
			return True
	
	
	return False
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array

## Explanation :

## Code :

```cpp
def hasSingleCycle(array):
    numElementsVisited = 0
	currentIdx = 0
	while numElementsVisited < len(array):
		if numElementsVisited > 0 and currentIdx == 0:
			return False
		numElementsVisited += 1
		currentIdx = getNextIdx(currentIdx,array)
	return currentIdx == 0

def getNextIdx(currentIdx,array):
	jump = array[currentIdx]
	nextIdx = (currentIdx + jump) % len(array)
	if jump == -400:
		print(nextIdx)
	return nextIdx if nextIdx >= 0 else nextIdx + len(array)
```
