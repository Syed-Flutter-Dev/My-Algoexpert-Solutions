# Problem Statement:

Boggle Board You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing letters; this matrix represents a boggle tX)ard. You're also given a list of words. Write a function that returns an array of all the words contained in the board. The final words don't need to be in any particular order. A word is constructed in the board by connecting adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) letters, without using any single letter at a given position more than once; while a word can of course have letters, those repeated letters must come from different in the board in order for the word to be contained in the board. Note that two or more words are allowed to overlap and use the same letters in the boggle board

## Sample Input

```cpp
board = [
  ["t", "h", "i", "s", "i", "s", "a"],
  ["s", "i", "m", "p", "l", "e", "x"],
  ["b", "x", "x", "x", "x", "e", "b"],
  ["x", "o", "g", "g", "l", "x", "o"],
  ["x", "x", "x", "D", "T", "r", "a"],
  ["R", "E", "P", "E", "A", "d", "x"],
  ["x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "x"],
  ["N", "O", "T", "R", "E", "-", "P"],
  ["x", "x", "D", "E", "T", "A", "E"],
],

words = [
  "this", "is", "not", "a", "simple", "boggle",
  "board", "test", "REPEATED", "NOTRE-PEATED",
]
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
["this", "is", "a", "simple", "boggle", "board", "NOTRE-PEATED"]
// The words could be ordered differently.
```

# *Solution 1 :*

- [x]  Done on my own

## Explanation :

holy fuck this was hard, took me 5 hours, too tired to write the solution. Bye.

## Code :

```cpp
from collections import deque
from collections import Counter

def boggleBoard(board, words):
		
	# Number of rows
	rows = len(board)
	
	# Number of cols
	cols = len(board[0])
	
	# first letters of all words
	firstLetters = list( map( lambda m : m[0] , words ) )
	
	# coords of letters
	coords = {}
	
	wordsFound = []
	
	# populate first letters
	for r in range(rows):
		for c in range(cols):
			
			# if firstLetter is in the board, save the coordinates
			if board[r][c] in firstLetters:
				coords[board[r][c]] = coords.get(board[r][c],[]) + [(r,c)]
	
	# Store Repeated letters for ease in BFS
	dups = {}
	for word in words:
		dups.setdefault(word,[])
				
	def bfs(i,j,word,n,rows,cols,board,repeatedLetters):
		visited = set()
		directions = ((1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(-1,0),(1,1),(-1,-1),(-1,1),(1,-1))
		queue = deque([(i,j)])
		
		def traverse(i,j,n,repeatedLetters,word):
			wordFormed = word[0]
			lastLetterFound = False
			
			while queue:
				currentletters = []
				record = {}
				
				# logic for duplicates
				for i,j in queue:
					record[board[i][j]] = record.get(board[i][j],0) + 1
					
					if board[i][j] not in currentletters:
						currentletters.append(board[i][j])
					else:
						dups[word] = dups.get(word,[]) + [board[i][j]]
						repeatedLetters = dups[word]
						if n<len(word) and board[i][j] == word[n]:
							n+=1
							
							
				for _ in range(len(queue)):
					i,j = queue.popleft()
					
					if (i,j) not in visited:
						visited.add((i,j))
						
						if n >= len(word):
							return True
					
						lastLetterFoundInThisIteration = False
						
						for a,b in directions:
							nexti,nextj = i+a , j+b
							
							if 0 <= nexti < rows and 0 <= nextj < cols and board[nexti][nextj]==word[n]:
								
								if (nexti,nextj) not in visited:
									
									lastLetterFound = True
									lastLetterFoundInThisIteration = True
									queue.append((nexti,nextj))
						
						# If repeated letter/letters do not yeild word,
						# remove them from visited
						if not lastLetterFoundInThisIteration and board[i][j] in repeatedLetters:
							index = n
							while word[index-1] in repeatedLetters:
								for r,c in visited.copy():
									if board[r][c] == word[index-1]:
										visited.remove((r,c))
								index -= 1
							

				if lastLetterFound:
					n += 1
					lastLetterFound = False
					
							
			return False	
		
		return traverse(i,j,n,repeatedLetters,word)		
				
	for word in words:
		
		coordinates = coords.get(word[0],[])
		
		for i,j in coordinates:
			wordFound = bfs(i,j,word,1,rows,cols,board,[])
			# print(wordFound)
			if wordFound:
				wordsFound.append(word)
				break
	
	return wordsFound
```
