# Problem Statement:

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k , rearranges the list in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new list) around nodes with value k , and returns its new head. 

Rearranging a Linked List around nodes with value k means moving all nodes with a value smaller than k before all nodeswith value k and moving all nodeswitha value greater than k after all nodeswith value k . 

All moved nodes should maintain their original relative ordering if possible. 

Note that the linked list should be rearranged even if it doesn't have any nodes with value k . 

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well asa next node pointing tothenext node in the listorto None / null if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least one node; in other words, the head will never be None / null .

## Sample Input

```cpp
head = 3 -> 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 
// the new head node with value 0
// Note that the nodes with values 0, 2, and 1 have
// maintained their original relative ordering, and
// so have the nodes with values 5 and 4.
```

## Explanation :

## Code :

```cpp
def rearrangeLinkedList(head, k):
	smallerListHead = None
	smallerListTail = None
	equalListHead = None
	equalListTail = None
	greaterListHead = None
	greaterListTail = None
	
	node = head
	
	while node is not None:
		
		if node.value < k:
			smallerListHead,smallerListTail = growLinkedList(smallerListHead,smallerListTail,node)
		elif node.value > k:
			greaterListHead,greaterListTail = growLinkedList(greaterListHead,greaterListTail,node)
		else:
			equalListHead,equalListTail = growLinkedList(equalListHead,equalListTail,node)
			
		prevNode = node
		node = node.next
		prevNode.next = None
		
	firstHead , firstTail = connectLinkedList(smallerListHead,smallerListTail,equalListHead,equalListTail)
	finalHead , _ = connectLinkedList(firstHead,firstTail,greaterListHead,greaterListTail)
	return finalHead

def connectLinkedList(headOne,tailOne,headTwo,tailTwo):
	newHead = headOne if headOne is not None else headTwo
	newTail = tailOne if tailTwo is None else tailTwo
	
	if tailOne is not None:
		tailOne.next = headTwo
	
	return (newHead,newTail)

def growLinkedList(head,tail,node):
	newHead = head
	newTail = node
	
	if newHead is None:
		newHead = node
	if tail is not None:
		tail.next = node
		
	return (newHead,newTail)
		
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Linked List

## Explanation :

INCREDIBLY NAIVE APPROACH

list = Linked List

Make Three lists :

- A list with elements less than k
- A list equal to k
- A list greater than k

join the f all of them

## Code :

```cpp
def rearrangeLinkedList(head, k):
	
	it = head
	thirdList = LinkedList(2)
	iterate = thirdList
	thirdLast = None
	
	# third loop for all elements greater than k
	while it is not None:
		if it.value > k:
			iterate.next = LinkedList(it.value)
			iterate = iterate.next
			thirdLast = iterate
		it = it.next
		
	it = head
	secondList = LinkedList(2)
	iterate = secondList
	secondLast = None
	# second loop for all elements equal to k
	while it is not None:
		if it.value == k:
			iterate.next = LinkedList(it.value)
			iterate = iterate.next
			secondLast = iterate
		it = it.next
	if thirdList.next is not None and secondLast is not None:
		secondLast.next = thirdList.next 
    
	it = head
	firstList = LinkedList(2)
	iterate = firstList
	firstLast = None
	# first loop for all elements less than k
	while it is not None:
		if it.value < k:
			iterate.next = LinkedList(it.value)
			iterate = iterate.next
			# print(it.value)
			firstLast = iterate
		it = it.next
		
	if firstLast is not None:
		if secondLast is None and thirdLast is not None:
				firstLast.next = thirdList.next
		else:
			firstLast.next = secondList.next
		
		
	lists = [firstList,secondList,thirdList]
	lasts = [firstLast,secondLast,thirdLast]
	
	for index,i in enumerate(lasts):
		if i is None:
			continue
		result = lists[index].next
		break
		
	it = result
	print("result")
	while it is not None:
		print(it.value)
		it = it.next
		
	return result
	

# This is the class of the input linked list.
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```
