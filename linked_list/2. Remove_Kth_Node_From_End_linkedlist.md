# *Problem Statement :*

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k and removes the kth node from the end of the list. 

The removal should be done in place, meaning that the original data structure should be mutated (no new structure should be created). 

Furthermore, the input head of the linked list should remain the head of the linked list after the removal is done, even if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed. 

In other words, if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed, your function should simply mutateits value and next pointer. 

Note that your function doesn't need to retum anything. 

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least two nodes and, more specifically, at least k nodes. 

Each LinkedList node hasan integer value aswellasa next node pointing tothenextnode in the listorto None / null if it's the tail of the list

## Sample Input

```cpp
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
k = 4
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
// No output required.
// The 4th node from the end of the list (the node with value 6) is removed.
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

## Code :

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class LinkedList {
public:
  int value;
  LinkedList *next;

  LinkedList(int value);
  void addMany(vector<int> values);
  vector<int> getNodesInArray();
};

void removeKthNodeFromEnd(LinkedList *head, int k) {
	
  LinkedList *leader = head;
	LinkedList *first = head;
	LinkedList *second = head;
	
	int count = 1;
	
	while(count<=k)
	{
		second = second->next;
		count++;
	}
	if(second == NULL)
	{
		// the only possibility assuming the "k" value is inside bounds
		// is that the head is has to be removed
		// that is when k == len(linkedlist)
		head->value = head->next->value;
		head->next = head->next->next;
		return;
	}
	while(second->next!=NULL)
	{
		second = second->next;
		first = first->next;
	}
	// remove node
	first->next = first->next->next;
}
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Linked List
