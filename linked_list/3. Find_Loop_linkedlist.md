# *Problem Statement :*

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List that contains a loop (in other words, the list's tail node to some node in the list instead of None / null.

The function should return the node (the actual nodeâ€”not just its value) from which the loop originates in constant space. 

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well asa next node in the list.

## Sample Input

```cpp
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
						   ^         v
                           9 <- 8 <- 7
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
4 -> 5 -> 6
^         v
9 <- 8 <- 7
```

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

In Code

## Code :

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class LinkedList {
public:
  int value;
  LinkedList *next;

  LinkedList(int value);
};

LinkedList *findLoop(LinkedList *head) {
  // Write your code here.
	LinkedList *first = head->next;
	LinkedList *second = head->next->next;
	
	// LOGIC
	// WHEN FIRST AND SECOND MEET
	// D => DISTANCE FROM HEAD TO LOOP ORIGIN
	// P => DISTANCE FROM LOOP ORIGIN TO POINTER
	// first has covered => D + P
	// second has covered => 2D + 2P
	// Total linkedlist distance => 2D + 2P - P => 2D + P
	// since 2d+2p covered by second, and first covered only p
	// Now what is the distance left for second?
	// T - [ distance covered by first which is D + P ] => D
	// Okay so now distance left for second is D, and if we start from head
	// and increment D times, we should meet second Too !
	while( first != second )
	{
		first = first->next;
		second = second->next->next;
	}
	
	first = head;
	
	while( first != second )
	{
		first = first->next;
		second = second->next;
	}

  return first;
}
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Linked List
