# Problem Statement:

Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer. 

The function should use a variation of the Binary Search algorithm to find a range of indices in between which the target number is contained in the array and should retum this range in the form of an array. 

The first number in the output array should represent the first index at which the target is located, while the second should representthe last indexatwhich the target number is located. 

Thefunction shmlld retum [-1, -1] if the integer isn't contained in the array.

## Sample Input

```cpp
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
target = 45
```

## Sample Output

```cpp
[ 4 , 9 ]
```

## Explanation :

[Binary Search tutorial (C++ and Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU7DpgHINWQ&list=PLl0KD3g-oDOHpWRyyGBUJ9jmul0lUOD80)

## Code :

```cpp
def searchForRange(array, target):
    
	first = -1
	last = -1
	
	# find the first occurence
	low = 0
	high = len(array)-1
	
	while low <= high:
		
		mid = (low + high)//2
		
		if array[mid] == target:
			first = mid
			high = mid - 1
			
		elif array[mid] > target:
			high = mid - 1
		
		else:
			low = mid + 1
	
	low = 0
	high = len(array) - 1
	# find the last occurrance
	while low <= high:
		
		mid = (low + high)//2
		
		if array[mid] == target:
			last = mid
			low = mid + 1
			
		elif array[mid] > target:
			high = mid - 1
		
		else:
			low = mid + 1
			
	return [first,last]
```
